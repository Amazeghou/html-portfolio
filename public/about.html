<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Smiggles, I’m 5 feet tall, a 22-year-old white male, and I am, without a doubt, a victim.
  Life has not been kind, I am drowning in a sea of debt so deep that even seasoned barely legal creators would look at my bank account and say, "Damn, that’s rough."
  To make ends meet, I spend my days slaving away at The Dilly, where my soul erodes at a rate faster than my credit score. 
  Every morning, I wake up at 4 AM just to drag myself to that godforsaken place, running on fumes and broken dreams. Sleep? Never met her.
  Desperation has driven me to the edge, and I have now ventured into creating barely legal content—emphasis on barely. 
  At this point, I’ve started seeing five Russian men on rotation, getting passed around like a tray of cheap supermarket sushi, all in the name of making ends meet. 
  If that wasn’t bad enough, Ellie Lawson has her firm grip on my boxers, wedging me into a financial chokehold, ensuring that whatever scraps I manage to scrounge up never actually belong to me.
  If you have even a shred of human decency (or a morbid curiosity for watching a financial car crash in real time), I would deeply appreciate any and all donations. 
  Every penny brings me one step closer to escaping this capitalist prison cell—otherwise known as my life.</p>
